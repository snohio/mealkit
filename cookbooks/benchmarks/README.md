# benchmarks

This cookbook only holds compliance profiles to be used in conjunction with Chef Client >= 17.5

You will need to make sure this cookbook is included in your metadata.rb dependencies and in your cookbook do an `include_profile 'benchmarks::(compliance_profile_directory_name)'`

Download the Benchmark and put it in the compliance/profiles/profilenameasitisintheyml
You might need to rename it!
